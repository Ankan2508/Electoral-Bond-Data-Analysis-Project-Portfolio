Info:

On 15th February, the Supreme Court of India scrapped the Electoral Bond Scheme introduced in 2018, which allowed anonymous political funding, and ordered the disclosure of donors, the amount they donated, and the recipients. The Election Commission published the electoral bonds data shared by SBI on its website. The data released showed the details of the purchase of electoral bonds by companies and individuals of denominations between Rs 1,000 to Rs 1 crore since April 12, 2019. 

In this Data Analysis Project, I have delved deep into the data and found some insights published in public by the State Bank of India right after that. 

The data was presented in two PDF files containing the donor data which included data of both companies and individual donors who donated and the Political parties data that collected those donations. 

After converting those files into Excel format I did all the data cleaning. Also, I divided the donors' data into two separate Excel files. One, with the companies' data and the other one with the individual donors' data. Also, I included the Head Quarter City, Head Quarter State/ Province, and Country columns in the company's Excel file. Lastly, I converted all files into CSV format for simplicity of usage. 

N.B.: This project is only for study and practice purposes. There is no intention to misuse the data as well as malign any individual, company, or political party.
